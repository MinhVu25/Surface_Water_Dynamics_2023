# Surface_Water_Dynamics
Supplementary Material to Journal paper 

Expected Published in 2023

This script aims to determine the most suitable threshold for surface water extraction from Sentinel-1 image and provide a fully automatic processing chain for detecting, monitoring surface water and mapping water dynamics. 

This code is under MIT licence and can be used freely, but you need to credit me (Vu Anh Minh) as the author and cite my publication in your report, paper, thesis, etc.

# The reposity includes 3 main scripts and 1 folder of reference data.
1. Most suitable threshold range
2. Optimal threshold selection
3. Water occurence map
4. Reference data

The brief instruction is shown in the scripts. Please find and read my paper to deeply understand function and usage of scripts.
